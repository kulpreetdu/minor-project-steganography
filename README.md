# minor-project-steganography
Taken color images and applied steganography on least significant bit of the image.
The image is divided into three channels i.e. red,green and blue.
We have taken four individual color images.
The least significant bit steganography is applied on the red channel, bue channel and green channel individually.
The least significant bit steganography is applied on the combined red channel, bue channel and green channel.
The peak signal to the noise ratio is calculated of the individual image on the individual channel and on the combined channel.
